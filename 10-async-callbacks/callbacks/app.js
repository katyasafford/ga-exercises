/**
 * Reinventing the Wheel: jQuery's $.get method
 *
 * Last class we saw how jqueryâ€™s $.get method facilitates making HTTP GET requests.
 * For this exercise you will implement your own $.get helper function.
 *
 * Directions
 *
 * 1. Your $.get method should take 3 parameters
 *     1. url string: A url to send the HTTP request to
 *     2. onSuccess: A callback function which should be called once data
 *        is returned from the server and a 200 was returned. The success body
 *        should be sent back to the callback as the only argument.
 *     3. onError: A callback function which should be called once a response
 *        was received and the status was not 200. The status and success body
 *        should be sent back to the callback as the only 2 arguments.
 * 2. You should use an XHR to make the underlying HTTP request.
 * 3. Bonus: Reinvent the $.ajax method.
 *
 * DO NOT USE JQUERY.

            //put this into separate function, so if you need other url, you can just add its own fucntion

            var date = response.time.updated;
